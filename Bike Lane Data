--Practing creating CTE's to find more specific information in the data

-- This table holds data about a city's bike lanes, including their safety ratings. 
-- How can we create a CTE that labels bike lanes on each street as safe when they have an average safety higher than 4?
WITH safety_average_cte AS (
SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) as 'rating'
FROM citybikelanes
GROUP BY street)

SELECT 
street,
rating,
'safe lane' as 'label'
FROM safety_average_cte
WHERE rating >=4

-- With this same data set, how can we use a window function to view the safety rating of both bike lanes on each street and the average saftey rating?
SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating"
FROM CityBikeLanes

-- Further illustrating how we can view the average safety rating of the bike lanes on 2nd St with a window function.
SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating"
FROM CityBikeLanes
WHERE street='2nd'

-- How can we create a list of reccommended actions for the bike lanes based on the average saftey ratings?
SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) as "Average_safety_rating",
CASE WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) >=4 THEN "Leave As-Is"
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) <2.5 THEN "Remove"
    ELSE "Improvements Needed"
    END AS "Recommendation"
